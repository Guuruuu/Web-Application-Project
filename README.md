# Deploy a Web Application on AWS with Docker, Load Balancer, Amazon ECR, and ECS. 

I demonstrated how to deploy a web application to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) using various tools such as EC2, Docker, Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Application Load Balancer in AWS.

1. I create an EC2 instance and install Docker on it.
Next, I containerize the web application using Docker and push the container image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
